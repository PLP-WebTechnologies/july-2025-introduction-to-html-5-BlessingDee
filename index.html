            <h2> My View Of the World</h2>
            <p> My perspective of how the world works differs from several people. I once referenced a song by Sasha Alex Sloan, "Santa's Real".</p>
            <p>Her lyrics talked about how she wished we lived in a world where nobody fell sick and nobody suffered. It was an emotional point of view and I could easily tap into that feeling. </p>
            <p>The world is such a painful space. Despite the merry, the goodness, I think the world breaks us more than we know. </p>
            <h2> This includes a List of the things we feel as humans </h2>
            <h3> Ordered Lists </h3>
            <ol type="i">
                <li> Joy </li>
                <li> Sadness </li>
                <li> Hurt </li>
                <li> Love </li>
